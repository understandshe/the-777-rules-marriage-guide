# The 777 Rules for Marriage: How a Napkin and a Stranger Saved Us

> "I don't know if I love you anymore." We were drowning in plain sight, becoming roommates with wedding rings. This is our raw story of using the **777 rules for couples** to find our way back.

### The Night Everything Changed
My husband forgot my birthday last year. Not the date - he knew that. He just... forgot. Like it was Tuesday. Like I was the mailman.

We'd been married seven years. Two kids. A mortgage. And somewhere between diaper changes and parent-teacher meetings, we stopped being "us." We became a management team. Efficient. Functional. Dead.

I remember sitting in our kitchen at 11 PM, eating cold pasta over the sink, wondering when exactly he'd stopped looking at me like I was the best thing in his life. When had I stopped looking at him that way too?

We were drowning in plain sight. And we didn't even know it.

### The 777 Rules That Found Us
It wasn't a therapist. Not a book. Not some TikTok guru.

It was a woman on a flight to Denver. I was crying silently into my complimentary pretzels - don't ask, bad day, worse month - and she just handed me a tissue and said, "Honey, when's the last time you saw your husband's eyes?"

I stared at her. Like she'd spoken another language.

She told me about these **777 rules** her grandparents lived by. Every 7 days, a date. Every 7 weeks, a night away. Every 7 months, an adventure. She called it "the rhythm that keeps love breathing."

I wrote it on a napkin. Stuffed it in my purse. Forgot about it for three weeks.

Then one Saturday, I found that napkin. Crumpled. Stained with coffee. And I looked at my husband across the breakfast table - really looked - and realized I couldn't remember the last time we'd been alone together for more than a grocery run.

### The First Seven Days
I asked him out. Like a date. Like we were strangers.

He laughed. Thought I was joking. Then saw my face and said yes. We went to that dive bar where we met. The one that closed down years ago and reopened as something else. It smelled different. The music was wrong. But we sat in the corner booth - our booth - and for two hours, we didn't talk about the kids or the bills or why the dishwasher was making that noise.

He reached across the table and held my hand. Like it was new. Like he was asking permission.

### The Seven Weeks That Changed Everything
The night away was harder. Logistics. Guilt. We checked into a hotel twenty minutes from our house. Pathetic, right? But it felt like another country. 

At 2 AM, he told me he'd been lonely. That he missed me. That he didn't know how to say it without sounding weak. I cried. He cried. We didn't fix everything. But we found each other again in that dark room. The **777 rules for marriage** aren't about perfect - they're about showing up. 

### Seven Months Later (The Costa Rica Trip)
We took that vacation. The big one. Costa Rica. Beach. No wifi. Just us and the sound of waves. 

By the time we got to that vacation, we'd built something. We weren't starting from zero. I saw the girl who fell in love with a boy who made her laugh until her stomach hurt. I saw her again. I think he saw the boy he loved too.

### When the Rules Became Ours
Look, I'm not saying the 777 rules are magic. I'm not saying they fix cheating or abuse. Andrew Buchan allegedly cheated on his wife Amy even after she asked for these rhythms. Rules don't fix what willingness won't.

But for us? For two people who still loved each other but forgot how to live that love out loud? The **777 rules of dating** saved us. They made priority automatic instead of impossible.

### What Nobody Tells You
The hardest part isn't the planning. It's the remembering why. Protecting the thing that matters most from the entropy of daily life.

My husband didn't forget my birthday this year. He planned a date. Our booth. Cold pasta - as a joke. And he looked at me like I was the best thing in his life. 

Because I am. Because he is. Because we remembered.

**When did you stop seeing your person? And what would it take to look again?**
